Plain text => 512 bits
MD5 = 128 bits

1. Append Padding => if less than 512 bits has to be 64 bits less than multiple of 512
2. Append 64 bit Representation 
    plain text length => multiple of 512 
3. Initialize the md buffers (size 32 bits) need 4 buffers 
4. Process each block (512)
5. output (message Digest in buffers)

Example:
    if the plain text is 
        512 - 64 = 448
        => 448+64 = 512 therefore its a multiple of 512
        1024 -54 = 960
        => 960+64 = 1024 therefore its a multiple of 512
