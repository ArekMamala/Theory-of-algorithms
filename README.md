## Thery Of Algorithms Project Statment
You must write a program in the C programming language [2] that calculates
the MD5 hash digest of an input. The algorithm is specified in the Request
For Comments 1321 document supplied by the Internet Engineering Task
Force [5]. The only pre-requisite is that your program performs the algorithm
â€” you are free to decide what input the algorithm should be performed on.
I suggest you allow the user to input some free text or a filename via the
command line.

## Project repository content
  This trepository consists of three folders 
  + .vscode
  + Md5
  + shaAlgorythm
  Also consists of 
  + gitignore
  + README.md
  
  #### shaAlgorythm folder
   This is the sha256 algorithm that has been developed through out finalyear semester 
   in the course "Theory Of Algorithms".
