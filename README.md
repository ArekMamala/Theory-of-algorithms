You must write a program in the C programming language [2] that calculates
the MD5 hash digest of an input. The algorithm is specified in the Request
For Comments 1321 document supplied by the Internet Engineering Task
Force [5]. The only pre-requisite is that your program performs the algorithm
â€” you are free to decide what input the algorithm should be performed on.
I suggest you allow the user to input some free text or a filename via the
command line.
