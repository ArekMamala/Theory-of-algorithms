## Thery Of Algorithms Project Statment
You must write a program in the C programming language [2] that calculates
the MD5 hash digest of an input. The algorithm is specified in the Request
For Comments 1321 document supplied by the Internet Engineering Task
Force [5]. The only pre-requisite is that your program performs the algorithm
â€” you are free to decide what input the algorithm should be performed on.
I suggest you allow the user to input some free text or a filename via the
command line.

## Project repository content
  This trepository consists of three folders 
  + .vscode
  + Md5
  + shaAlgorythm
  Also consists of 
  + gitignore
  + README.md
  
  #### shaAlgorythm folder
   This is the sha256 algorithm that has been developed through out finalyear semester 
   in the course "Theory Of Algorithms".
   + README.md
   + Readme
   + hello.c
   + hello.py
   + lookatbits
   + lookatbits.c
   + padding.c
   + sha256
   + sha256.c
   + unions.c
  
  #### Md5 folder
   + Assets folder
     + MessageAndDiggest.pnh
     + ProccessingOfInputPart1.jpg

   + test
  
  ## How to run
   #### To run the sha256 
   1. Clone the repository 
     + using terminal command "git clone https://github.com/ArekMamala/EmergingTechnologies.git"  
     + or download zip and unzip it in chses destination
   1. make your way into the shaAlgorythm folder using the following command
     + "cd shaAlgorythm"
   1. using terminal compile the algorithm using this command
     + "sudo gcc sha25d.c" 
   1. using terminal run the folowing command to run algorithm
     + "./a.out test" 
       + "a.out" is the file created by compiling the c code
       + "test" is a testing empty text file
   
   #### To run the md5 
   1. Clone the repository 
     + using terminal command "git clone https://github.com/ArekMamala/EmergingTechnologies.git"  
     + or download zip and unzip it in chses destination
   1. make your way into the Md5 folder using the following command
     + "cd Md5"
   1. using terminal compile the algorithm using this command
     + "sudo gcc md5.c" 
   1. using terminal run the folowing command to run algorithm
     + "./a.out test" 
       + "a.out" is the file created by compiling the c code
       + "test" is a testing empty text file
