~~An introduction to your repository and code. Describe
what is contained in the repository and what the code does.~~

<i> Theory of Algorithm project 2020 - Ian McLoughlin</i><br>
At the begining of my second semester during my fourth academic year in the module Theory of Algorithms we were given a complicated task by the Lecturer Ian McLoughlin to complete.<br><br>
The task stated <br>
<i>You must write a program in the C programming language that calculates the MD5 hash digest of an input. The algorithm is specified in the Request For Comments 1321 document supplied by the Internet Engineering Task Force. The only pre-requisite is that your program performs the algorithm â€” you are free to decide what input the algorithm should be performed on. I suggest you allow the user to input some free text or a filename via the command line.</i><br>
<br>It was difficult for me to understand the assigment and have the knowlege on where to start on the problem given to us. I knew that it was the begining of the semester and the reason for us studying this module is because its requires new theories and new algorithms for us to reasearch and understand before we could start on any coading.<br>
<br>To the best of my knowledge, I belive that how most students felt at the start of the semester, I feel thats only right and it signifies that the module was given a lot of consideration a "module right for the students".
<br>
#### Repository
The repository contains two algorithms developed during this semmester in this module. We had studied the sha256 and the Md5 algorithms. These two algorithms are very similar in a way and we find that out while coding up both of them and comparing them side by side.<br>
In the "Theory-of-Algorithms" directory contains a README.md file which describes to the visitors and users what the repository contains and how to deploy the algorithms present.
The md5 folder consists of only the necessary files for the md5 algorithm.


### <p align="center">Run
~~You should explain how to download, compile, and run your code.
Include instructions of how to install the compiler.~~
### <p align="center">Test
~~Explain how to run the tests included in your code.

### <p align="center">Algorithm 
~~Give an overview and explanation of the main algorithm(s)
in your code. You might use a well-thought out diagram here.~~

### <p align="center">Complexity 
~~This should be the most significant part of the report.
You must give an analysis of the complexity of the MD5 algorithm,
including the complexity of algorithms that attempt to reverse the
algorithm. That is, algorithms that attempt to find an input for
which the MD5 algorithm produces a given output. You should
research this topic before writing this section and your analysis
should be carefully referenced.~~
### <p align="center">References 
~~Provide a list of references used in your project. The
references should not just be a list of websites. Instead, there
should be a short explanation of why each reference is relevant to
your document.~~
