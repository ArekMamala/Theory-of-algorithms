#### <p align="center"> Student name: Arkadiusz Mamala <br>Student Number: G0034088 
### <p align="center">Introduction 
~~An introduction to your repository and code. Describe
what is contained in the repository and what the code does.~~

### <p align="center">Run
~~You should explain how to download, compile, and run your code.
Include instructions of how to install the compiler.~~
### <p align="center">Test
~~Explain how to run the tests included in your code.

### <p align="center">Algorithm 
~~Give an overview and explanation of the main algorithm(s)
in your code. You might use a well-thought out diagram here.~~
### <p align="center">Complexity 
~~This should be the most significant part of the report.
You must give an analysis of the complexity of the MD5 algorithm,
including the complexity of algorithms that attempt to reverse the
algorithm. That is, algorithms that attempt to find an input for
which the MD5 algorithm produces a given output. You should
research this topic before writing this section and your analysis
should be carefully referenced.~~
### <p align="center">References 
~~Provide a list of references used in your project. The
references should not just be a list of websites. Instead, there
should be a short explanation of why each reference is relevant to
your document.~~
